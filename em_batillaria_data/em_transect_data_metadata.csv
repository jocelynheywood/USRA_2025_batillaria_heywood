"Each row is one quadrat from a transect, there were 3 transects per beach and 10 quadrats per transect"

"transect = 1, 2 or 3 to indicate which transect this was"
quadrat = the quadrat number (1-10)
"quadrat size = large or small quadrat. L = 0.2401 m2, S = 0.0961 m2"
number_snails = how many snails were in the quadrat
position = distance of the quadrat from the beginning of the quadrat (which started at the high tide line)
ph = measured ph of the water
prev = proportion of the 5 snails dissected per quadrat that were infected with the trematode parasite. This should be between 0 - 1.
"substrate = type of substrate under the quadrat (rock, sandy_mud, sand, mud)"
